**#Project Description:**     
This Java Console-Based Quiz App is a simple interactive command-line application that presents multiple-choice 
questions to the user.The user answers each question by typing the option letter (A, B, C, or D), and the program 
gives real-time feedback (Correct/Wrong), maintains the score, and calculates the final percentage.       

It demonstrates core Java concepts such as:        

-Classes and objects   
-Collection framework (ArrayList)         
-Input handling         
-Control flow (if-else, loops)         
-Basic OOP principles (Encapsulation)             

**#Objective:**      
To develop a console-based quiz system in Java that:   

-Displays questions with four options      
-Accepts user input      
-Validates the answer     
-Scores the user      
-Displays result with percentage     

**#Key Concepts Covered:**
-Java ArrayList       
-Class creation (Question)      
-Loops (for)            
-Conditionals (if-else)        
-Encapsulation            
-Scanner for user input        
-char and String manipulations       

**#Tools & Technologies Used:**    
Language: Java (JDK 8+)
